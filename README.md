# Vivado Verilog Collection

This repository contains small Vivado projects (muxes, demuxes, adders, encoders/decoders, Gray code, etc.). Each project directory is standalone and includes:

- sources_1/new/: synthesizable Verilog modules (dut.v)
- sim_1/new/: simple testbenches (	b.v)

Generated Vivado artifacts are ignored to keep the repo lightweight.

## Quick start (simulation with xsim)

You can simulate directly with Vivado's xsim via the generated scripts, or re-add the sources to a fresh Vivado project.

### Option A: Recreate a clean project
1. Open Vivado.
2. Create a new project and add the module dut.v and 	b.v from the project's sources_1/new and sim_1/new folders.
3. Set the top for simulation to 	b (or the testbench module name in 	b.v).
4. Run simulation.

### Option B: Use existing scripts (Windows)
In many */sim_1/behav/xsim folders there are compile.bat, laborate.bat, and simulate.bat scripts. They are ignored by git but can be regenerated by Vivado. If you choose to commit only sources, re-run simulation by adding the files in a new Vivado project as in Option A.

## Projects included

- mux4x1, mux8x1
- demux4x1, demux8x1
- ncoders, decoders
- Gates
- Full_adder, half adder
- inary-grey

## Repo layout

`
root/
  <project>/
    <project>.srcs/
      sources_1/new/dut.v   # synthesizable
      sim_1/new/tb.v        # testbench
    # other Vivado-generated folders are ignored
`

## Notes
- Keep HDL minimal and portable.
- Prefer synthesizable constructs in dut.v.
- Testbenches may use initial blocks and $monitor/.
