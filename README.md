## Vivado Verilog Collection

This repository contains a set of small, self-contained Vivado projects for foundational digital design blocks:
- Multiplexers/Demultiplexers (4x1, 8x1)
- Encoders/Decoders
- Logic Gates
- Adders (Half, Full)
- Binary â†” Gray code

Each project directory is standalone and typically includes:
- sources_1/new/: synthesizable Verilog module(s), e.g. dut.v
- sim_1/new/: simple testbench(es), e.g. 	b.v

Generated Vivado artifacts are intentionally excluded to keep the repo small and focused on HDL sources.

### Quick start (simulate with Vivado xsim)
You can either add the sources into a new project or regenerate scripts in Vivado.

1) Create a clean project in Vivado
- Create a new project.
- Add sources_1/new/dut.v and sim_1/new/tb.v from the chosen project folder.
- Set the simulation top to the testbench module (usually 	b).
- Run simulation.

2) Use generated scripts (if present)
- Some sim_1/behav/xsim folders include compile.bat, laborate.bat, simulate.bat.
- These are not tracked by git and can be regenerated by Vivado if missing.

### Projects included (examples)
- mux4x1, mux8x1
- demux4x1, demux8x1
- ncoders, decoders
- Gates
- Full_adder, half adder
- inary-grey

### Repository layout
`
root/
  <project>/
    <project>.srcs/
      sources_1/new/dut.v   # synthesizable module(s)
      sim_1/new/tb.v        # testbench(es)
    # other Vivado-generated folders are ignored
`

### Notes
- Keep HDL portable and synthesizable in dut.v.
- Testbenches may use initial blocks and $monitor/$display as needed.
